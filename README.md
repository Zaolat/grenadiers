# AOE3DE - Grenadiers
> Conceptual Mod for AOE3DE Grenadiers (WIP).

## **Short Description**
This mod turns grenadiers in a *skirmish type* unit (*rifle infantry*), and add a new grenadier called **Heavy Grenadier**, which is a heavy hand infantry (kind of a weaker doppelsoldner) available to the civilizations that originally had access to grenadiers (British, Dutch, Ottomans, Russians and Swedes). It receive a charged grenade throw ability after researching *incendiary grenades*, and receive a musket ranged attack after receiving the *grenade launchers* card (they become a kind of *musketeer*).

## **Full Description**
Grenadiers are an underused unit with a bit of an identity crisis: it's a heavy infantry that can't fulfill the normal role of a heavy infantry but it’s also bad at being a rifle infantry (skirmisher). Grenade launchers really improve the unit, but it becomes hard to balance.

This mod split the unit in 2: one that’s a heavy infantry and another that’s a rifle infantry.
